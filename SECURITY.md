# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you identify a vulnerability you believe to be appropriate for disclosure to the public, do not hesitate to open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/davidemerson/cherubgyre/issues).

If you identify a vulnerability which you believe to be too critical to raise as a GitHub Issue, such as one which would require coordinated disclosure, please [check our security.txt](https://cherubgyre.com/.well-known/security.txt) for a valid address at which we can be contacted, or to validate communications you may receive from us using our public key.

## Acknowledgements
As vulnerabilities are found, we will publish a list of acknowledgements here.
